I created a PWA (Progressive Web App) with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Firebase to host my site while using the Cloud FireStore function to store my data in a database.

It allow the user to see their favourite recipes on the screen in a website view or in a mobile web app view if they install it onto their home-screen. 

The user can also add new recipes and delete old recipes while visiting different pages with a stable connection. However, if they're having connection difficulties then the realtime info will not be updated on the FireStore database until they regain connection again.

But, it will still allow the user to browse around the site even if they have no internet connection that's the beauty of PWA with only some limitation.
